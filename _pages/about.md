Hi, I am Shixiong Hu. I am now a PhD student at the University of Connecticut, Department of Earth Sciences. I have board research interests in simulating past catastrophic climatic disasters and their infrastructure damages, including asteroid impacts, wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. Currently, I am fascinated with the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction (66Ma), triggered by global wildfires coincident with the Chicxulub Asteroid impact that eliminated over 75% of the species on Earth. I have been using CESM-CARMA model on the Cheyenne supercomputer to perform climate simulations.

In my spare time, I love reading Philosophy works from Ludwig Wittgenstein. His work and quotes inspire me to keep moving and pursue a meaningful life. Moreover, I also love writing and reading fantasy novels.
